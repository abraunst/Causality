This is the model reduction section

Some parameters are kept fixed:
Graph : proximity with density 2.2/N

inf_out = GaussianRate(λ, T/2, 1/ε)
l_delay = GaussianRate(0.5, T/2, 1/ε)
r_delay = GaussianRate(0.1, T/2, 1/ε)

****** Unbiased Case (MarkovMS folder) ******
lam = 0.3 

****** Biased (acc.ratio = 1/12) Case (MarkovMSb folder) ******
lam = 0.15
