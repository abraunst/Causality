# Causality

This is the repository Causal Variational Approach (CVA) method. 
In the folder RandomWalk there is a Notebook which contains both the code and results obtained for the conditioned random walk problem. 
The folder src cointains the source code for the more complex problem of Epidemic Inference. 
In the folder Epidemics there is an introductory example in the notebook Example which uses the code in src/ to simulate and infere simple epidemic instances. The folder Epidemics/Results contains the folders of data obtained by simulation and inference. This data can be reproduced by runnning the notebooks in the sub-folder SimCodes and can be plotted running the notebook Pictures.
